The solution takes help of binary search algorithm:

Problem statement:

1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6,7,7

Answer: 4

Condition:
- Only one element will be single in the array.
- Rest of the elements will be double.

Step-wise explanation

1. First check if either of the first or last element is single
2. If not then, leftIndex will be 1 and rightIndex will be n-2
3. Get midIndex and check if the mid element is single
4. If not then, check if the mid element is in the left half or right half
    - If mid is in the left half, then eliminate left half, because left side will always contain double elements
    - If mid is in the right half, then eliminate right half, because right half will always contain double elements
5. continue 2 till we don't get the single element
